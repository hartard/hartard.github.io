My name is Falco Hartard. 
I studied economics and political science. Now, I work for the Liberal Democrats in Hesse.
My interests are data analysis, social media communication and policy.
I am especially interested in communication behaviors and automated hate speech detection.
Further, I study infrastructure, mobility and transportation. And their implementation via policy.
